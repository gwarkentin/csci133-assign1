Assignment Description:  Write a program in C++ that takes in two integer arguments from the command line (eg. assign1 15 39) and then prints the following:

The sum of the two numbers
The difference 
The product
The average
The distance (absolute value of the difference)
The maximum (larger of the two)
The minimum (smaller of the two)

Create one method for each function and return the result once the two integers have been entered. With your output, label each item as its printed out (for instance: "sum: 54, diff:-24" etc). Be sure to comment your code! Note: in order to use the min and max functions, you will need to use std::min and std::max library functions. Accepting arguments from the command line will also require the use of the argv function.


Notes: This is my first CS class in 6 years so I expect to be a bit rusty for a while. Since this is a new beggining to my CS schooling I'm actually diving in head first. Currently I'm learning Vim since all my programming for this class will be done via SSH to the CS Linux server. I'm also learning Racket personally to broaden my programming skillset. I will be hosting all my assignments to GitHub so I can track my progress as well.

I have in the meantime done some VBA programming to automate tasks in Excel for work as well as a couple Python scripts to manipulate multiple spreadsheets together. My practical application approach has been, "how can I get this working well enough quickly enough to be saving time before the process ultimately changes" rather than a more "proper" method.
