Assignment Description.  Write a program in C++ that takes in two integer arguments from the command line (eg. assign1 15 39) and then prints the following:

The sum of the two numbers
The difference 
The product
The average
The distance (absolute value of the difference)
The maximum (larger of the two)
The minimum (smaller of the two)

Create one method for each function and return the result once the two integers have been entered. With your output, label each item as its printed out (for instance: "sum: 54, diff:-24" etc). Be sure to comment your code! Note: in order to use the min and max functions, you will need to use std::min and std::max library functions. Accepting arguments from the command line will also require the use of the argv function.
